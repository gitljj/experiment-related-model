# expriment-related-model
This repository contains research and analysis on the energy consumption of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) 3D printers. The project includes detailed models calculated in Python, data organized in Excel, and 20 STL format files related to the research.

## Overview

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) 3D printing is a prominent additive manufacturing technique used for creating complex metal parts. Understanding the energy consumption of SLM 3D printers is crucial for optimizing printing processes, reducing costs, and minimizing environmental impact. This project aims to provide a comprehensive model of energy consumption for SLM 3D printers based on various parameters and stages of the printing process.

## Repository Structure

- `/stl_files` - Contains 20 STL format files representing different components or configurations used in the study.
- `/energy_model` - Contains Python scripts and Excel file used to calculate the energy consumption model of the SLM 3D printer.
- `/instance` - Txt files organizing the data of tested instances.
